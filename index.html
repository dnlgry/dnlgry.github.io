							<h1>Hello there …</h1>
							<p class="major">I’m Daniel, a trainee psychotherapist with extensive experience supporting individuals who are looking for a safe, confidential, and comfortable space for deeply personal, thoughtful conversations.</P>

							<h2>Talking really helps</h2>
							<p>It’s easy to think that we should be able to handle things on our own, but sometimes it’s the act of talking that opens the door to clarity. Having someone truly listen - without judgment or expectation - can bring out insights that stay hidden in the rush of daily life. Through conversation, we often begin to understand ourselves better and find a sense of relief in sharing what we’ve been carrying.</p>
							<p>Talking allows us to explore thoughts and emotions that may feel too overwhelming or complex to face alone. It’s not about having answers right away, but about creating the space to voice what matters, knowing someone is there to hold it with you. Sometimes, just saying things out loud can shift the way we see them, and in that shift, healing begins.</p>

							<h2>How we'll work together</h2>
							<p>Our work together will be a collaboration, shaped by your needs and experiences. We’ll take time to explore what feels important to you, allowing the process to unfold naturally, without rushing. Whether you come with a specific issue or just a sense that something isn’t quite right, we’ll move at your pace, creating a space where you feel supported in understanding yourself more deeply.</p>
							<p>This isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. I draw from different perspectives and methods to meet you where you are. Together, we’ll reflect on patterns, emotions, and experiences, always with the aim of helping you navigate life with greater ease and clarity. This is your journey, and I’m here to walk alongside you as you find your way through it.</p>

							<h2>A bit about me</h2>
							<p>I’m currently training as a psychotherepist at Metanoia Institute, building on previous training in therapeutic skills and in Jungian psychology. Before I began my career in therapy, I spent years working across various fields, including physics, consulting, and thought leadership. These diverse experiences give me a broad perspective and a deep understanding of how different aspects of life can intersect.</p>
							<p>With a deep interest in philosophy, my identity as a gay man, and my background as a musician, I bring a wide range of perspectives to my work. I believe these varied influences help me connect with individuals from all walks of life, offering a space where you can explore your experiences, knowing I will meet you with openness and curiosity.</p>
							<p>I also have significant experience supporting individuals in healing from complex trauma, including through hypnotherapy, music, breathwork, and the use of traditional medicines in altered states.</p>

							<h2>What we can explore together</h2>
							<p>Over the course of our work together, we may explore a wide range of topics depending on your needs and personal journey. Regardless of the area of focus, I offer a supportive environment where we can delve into these areas with care and thoughtfulness. Each of these experiences is deeply personal, and together, we will take the time to understand what is most meaningful to you.</p>

									<h3>Anxiety and Stress</h3>
									<p>Anxiety and stress often arise when we feel disconnected from ourselves. Gently exploring the source of these feelings can offer relief and help restore a sense of balance.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i>
									<h3>Relationships</h3>

								</section>
								<section>
									<i class="fa-solid fa-rainbow"></i>
									<h3>Sexuality</h3>
									<p>Growing up queer in a straight world can deeply influence how we engage with relationships and the world around us. Reflecting on how our sexuality shapes our identity and experiences can offer a sense of clarity and self-acceptance.</p>

								</section>
								<section>
									<i class="fa-solid fa-heart-crack"></i>
									<h3>Grief and Loss</h3>

								</section>
								<section>
									<i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i>
									<h3>Psychedelic Integration</h3>
									<p>Psychedelic experiences can open doors to new perspectives, but they can also leave us with questions. Taking the time to integrate these experiences can help ground the insights and emotions that arise. Note that I do not work with or endorse the use of illegal substances.</p>

						<h2>Fees and terms</h2>
						<p>My work is focused on 1:1 sessions, conducted in-person at my practice in Clerkenwell. My rate is £60 per 50-minute session, payable in advance by card or cash. Cancellations with less than 24 hours’ notice incur the full session fee.</p>
						<p>I seek to bring my experience, training, and perspective to offer accessible support for those seeking a space to reflect, explore, and better understand themselves. If I believe that your needs would be better met by a licenced clinician, I will always seek to direct you to the appropriate support to best serve your well-being.</p>
