							<h2>Talking really helps</h2>
							<p>It’s easy to think that we should be able to handle things on our own, but sometimes it’s the act of talking that opens the door to clarity. Having someone truly listen - without judgment or expectation - can bring out insights that stay hidden in the rush of daily life. Through conversation, we often begin to understand ourselves better and find a sense of relief in sharing what we’ve been carrying.</p>
							<p>Talking allows us to explore thoughts and emotions that may feel too overwhelming or complex to face alone. It’s not about having answers right away, but about creating the space to voice what matters, knowing someone is there to hold it with you. Sometimes, just saying things out loud can shift the way we see them, and in that shift, healing begins.</p>

							<h2>How we'll work together</h2>
							<p>Our work together will be a collaboration, shaped by your needs and experiences. We’ll take time to explore what feels important to you, allowing the process to unfold naturally, without rushing. Whether you come with a specific issue or just a sense that something isn’t quite right, we’ll move at your pace, creating a space where you feel supported in understanding yourself more deeply.</p>
							<p>This isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. I draw from different perspectives and methods to meet you where you are. Together, we’ll reflect on patterns, emotions, and experiences, always with the aim of helping you navigate life with greater ease and clarity. This is your journey, and I’m here to walk alongside you as you find your way through it.</p>

							<h2>A bit about me</h2>
							<p>I have over five years' experience providing talking therapy from my private practices in London and Melbourne, with relevant training and studies spanning integrative psychotherapy, mental health, therapeutic skills and Jungian psychology. With an extensive professional background in physics, consulting, academia, and thought leadership, I bring a broad perspective on how different aspects of life intersect.</p>
							<p>As someone deeply interested in existential and classical philosophy, spirituality, and working in altered states, I connect with people from all walks of life with openness, curiosity, and without judgment. My experience ranges from supporting individuals healing from complex trauma, to helping those seeking clarity on present challenges, to preparing for and integrating insights from altered states.</p>

							<p>Over the course of our work together, we may explore a wide range of topics depending on your needs and personal journey. Regardless of the area of focus, I offer a supportive environment where we can delve into these areas with care and thoughtfulness. Each of these experiences is deeply personal, and together, we will take the time to understand what is most meaningful to you.</p>

									<h3>Anxiety and Stress</h3>
									<p>Anxiety and stress often arise when we feel disconnected from ourselves. Gently exploring the source of these feelings can offer relief and help restore a sense of balance.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<!-- <i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i> -->
									<h3>Relationships</h3>
									<p>How we relate to others can mirror how we relate to ourselves. Exploring your relationship patterns can offer valuable insights into your personal connections and help foster more authentic ways of being with others.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<!-- <i class="fa-solid fa-joint"></i> -->
									<h3>Addiction</h3>
									<p>Addictive patterns often emerge from a place of deep pain or longing. Reflecting on the root of these behaviours can offer a sense of understanding and pave the way for healing.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<!-- <i class="fa-solid fa-rainbow"></i> -->
									<h3>Sexuality</h3>
									<p>Growing up queer in a straight world can deeply influence how we engage with relationships and the world around us. Reflecting on how our sexuality shapes our identity and experiences can offer a sense of clarity and self-acceptance.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<!-- <i class="fa-solid fa-compass"></i> -->
									<h3>Self-Exploration and Identity</h3>
									<p>Understanding who we are is a lifelong journey. Reflecting on your sense of identity, and how it shifts over time, can bring a deeper awareness of yourself and your place in the world.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<!-- <i class="fa-solid fa-route"></i> -->
									<h3>Life Transitions</h3>
									<p>Major life changes can bring a mixture of emotions—uncertainty, excitement, fear. Reflecting on these transitions can help ease the emotional impact and support you in finding your way through.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<!-- <i class="fa-solid fa-heart-crack"></i> -->
									<h3>Grief and Loss</h3>
									<p>Loss, in all its forms, can bring about a range of emotions. Being present with those feelings can create space for healing, allowing the process of grief to unfold naturally and gently.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<!-- <i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i> -->
									<h3>Existential Concerns</h3>
									<p>Life’s big questions can feel overwhelming—What is my purpose? Why am I here? Exploring these existential concerns can help you find meaning and navigate periods of uncertainty.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<!-- <i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> -->
									<h3>Psychedelic Integration</h3>
									<p>Psychedelic experiences can open doors to new perspectives, but they can also leave us with questions. Taking the time to integrate these experiences can help ground the insights and emotions that arise. Note that I do not work with or endorse the use of illegal substances.</p>
